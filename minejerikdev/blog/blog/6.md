Hello Everybody! I have started to move this website from flask to django. 
I have a few reasons for this move, that I will explain in this blog post.

## Reason 1

Extensiblity, I want to be able to add to my website very easily, and with django I would be able too.

## Reason 2

Support, there is more support for django than flask.

## Reason 3

I want to, I am bored and want to do something.

Thats it, thank you for reading this very short blogpost!
